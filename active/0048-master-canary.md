# Summary

Rename the `master` branch `canary`. We recognize that this is contentious and are seeking community feedback.

# Motivation

The goal is to make it a bit more clear which channel you're on without having to mirror commits between `master` and a `canary` branch.

# Drawbacks

This makes it a bit more confusing for new contributors to the project, but is neatly handled by GitHub's interface.

# Alternatives

Do nothing.
